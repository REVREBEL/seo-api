## Usage

Invoke any skill by name:

```
/seojuice-skills:audit example.com
/seojuice-skills:brief "best project management tools"
/seojuice-skills:find-keywords
```

Or just describe what you need — Claude will pick the right skill:

```

> What keywords should I target for my SaaS blog?
```

## Examples

### Run a Full SEO Audit

```
> /seojuice-skills:audit example.com
```

Returns a 5-layer audit (technical, on-page, content, links, competitive) with a health score, critical issues, and a 90-day action plan.

### Create a Content Brief

```
> /seojuice-skills:brief "best CRM for small business"
```

Analyzes the current SERP, maps search intent, builds a detailed outline with H2/H3 structure, sets SEO targets (word count, keywords, internal links), and defines what makes your piece better than what already ranks.

### Find Keywords for a New Product

```
> /seojuice-skills:find-keywords
> My SaaS product is an AI writing assistant for marketers. We want to grow organic traffic.
```

Builds a tiered keyword universe (head, body, long-tail), classifies by intent, scores by opportunity, and groups into cluster seeds for your content roadmap.

### Fix Internal Linking Issues

```
> /seojuice-skills:fix-linking example.com
```

Maps hub-and-spoke structure, identifies orphan pages, checks anchor text diversity, and produces a concrete link injection plan with specific source → target page pairs.

### Recover Traffic on Declining Pages

```
> /seojuice-skills:recover-content
> Our blog post on "email marketing best practices" dropped from 2k to 500 clicks/month over 6 months.
```

Runs the decay triage framework — determines if the content is outdated, cannibalized, or if intent has shifted — and produces specific refresh, consolidation, or redirect actions.

### Build a Topic Cluster from Scratch

```
> /seojuice-skills:build-clusters
> We sell project management software and want to own the "agile" topic.
```

Discovers subtopics, maps the pillar-spoke structure, scores existing coverage gaps, designs the interlinking plan, and sequences content production.

### Diagnose Why Pages Aren't Ranking

```
> /seojuice-skills:diagnose-seo example.com
```

Works through 4 diagnostic layers (crawlability → indexability → renderability → signals) with specific checks at each layer and actionable fixes.

### Audit Page Speed

```
> /seojuice-skills:audit-speed https://example.com/pricing
```

Runs LCP, CLS, and INP root-cause trees to pinpoint exactly why a page is slow, breaks down resource sizes, and prioritizes fixes by impact.

### Target SERP Features

```
> /seojuice-skills:target-serp
> We want to win featured snippets for "what is SEO" and "SEO tools comparison"
```

Audits current SERP features for each keyword, determines which features are winnable, and provides formatting/schema markup instructions to capture them.

### Plan a Competitive Attack

```
> /seojuice-skills:beat-competitors
> Our main competitors are ahrefs.com, semrush.com, and moz.com
```

Analyzes keyword overlap, scores each gap by winnability and business value, and produces a sequenced attack plan: quick wins, gap fills, and long-term plays.

### Design a Link Building Campaign

```
> /seojuice-skills:build-links
> We have a SaaS tool with a free tier and a blog with original research.
```

Maps linkable assets, selects the best strategy (original research, broken link building, guest posts), scores prospects, and designs outreach sequences.

### Optimize for AI Search

```
> /seojuice-skills:optimize-for-ai example.com
```

Audits AI crawler access, content extractability, brand entity signals, and produces an optimization plan for getting cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews.

### Build Local SEO Presence

```
> /seojuice-skills:rank-local
> We're a dental practice in Austin, TX with 3 locations.
```

Audits Google Business Profile completeness, checks NAP consistency, builds a citation strategy for dental-specific directories, and plans review velocity.

### Plan a Site Migration

```
> /seojuice-skills:migrate-site
> We're moving from WordPress to Next.js and restructuring all our blog URLs.
```

Produces a complete migration plan: redirect mapping, pre/post-migration checklists, monitoring schedule, and rollback criteria.
